  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>Sustainable Face Masks is a startup company founded on 2020, aimed at creating highly effective and sustainable face masks which will protect not only your health and your family´s health, but also the planet Earth. The COVID-19 pandemic has been teaching human kind how fragile life is, and how we, as humans, have been mistreating nature, taking it for granted. We commit to take a step foward in this journey of re-inventing ourselves and creating new ways of co-existing in harmony with nature, and regain it´s respect. Sustainable Face Masks@ invite you to join us in this path to sustainability, while being protective with yours and other´s health.  </p>
